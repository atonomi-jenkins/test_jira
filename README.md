# test_jira
Test repo for Jira integration
7/06 - testing webhooks with Jira Cloud
Comment propagated successfully - now try status change
#Define acceptance did not work, although it was propagated
Will try #Reject now
Granted access to that repo to vkhozyainov. Now will try to comment under vkhozyainov username.
Comment propagated OK. Now will try to change status to 'Acceptance criteria define' via #Define acceptance
#Define acceptance propagated, but did not effect a change. Will try #Reject now.
Revoked OAuth issued from vkhozyainov - will webhooks still work? Also left only atonomi.io email.
